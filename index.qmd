# 🎲 Simulation Challenge - Monte Carlo Analysis

## Challenge Overview

**Your Mission:** Create a comprehensive Quarto document that simulates one or two investment strategies, analyzes the results, and demonstrates your ability to present counter-intuitive findings compellingly. Then render the document to HTML and deploy it via GitHub Pages from a new repository called "simulationChallenge."

## ⚠️ AI Partnership Required

This challenge pushes boundaries intentionally. You'll tackle problems that normally require weeks of study, but with Cursor AI as your partner (and your brain keeping it honest), you can accomplish more than you thought possible.

**The new reality:** The four stages of competence are Ignorance → Awareness → Learning → Mastery. AI lets us produce Mastery-level work while operating primarily in the Awareness stage. I focus on awareness training, you leverage AI for execution, and together we create outputs that used to require years of dedicated study.

## The Investment Game 🎯

### Original Game Strategy

::: {#exm-ErgodicityEconomicsExample}
Imagine you are offered the following game and given a $1,000 budget in a special account to play the game: I will flip a coin, and if it comes up heads, we increase your account's balance by 50%; if it comes up tails, we reduce your account's balance by 40%. We are not only doing this once, but we will do it once per year until you turn 55. When you turn 55, you will receive the balance in your account.

## Grading Rubric 🎓

### Questions to Answer for 75% Grade on Challenge

1. **Expected Value Analysis:** What is the "expected value" of your account balance after 1 coin flip for the original game?

## The expected value of the account balance after 1 coin flip for the original game is $1000 * (0.5 * 1.5 + 0.5 * 0.6) = $1050. Therefore, the expected value is positive and $1050.

```{python}
#| label: q1-expected-value
#| echo: true

initial_balance = 1000
gain_rate = 0.5    # +50% on heads
loss_rate = 0.4    # -40% on tails

# Expected value after one flip:
# E[B1] = 0.5 * (B0 * 1.5) + 0.5 * (B0 * 0.6)
expected_value = initial_balance * (0.5 * (1 + gain_rate) + 0.5 * (1 - loss_rate))

print(f"Starting balance: ${initial_balance:,.0f}")
print(f"Expected value after one flip: ${expected_value:,.0f}")
```

2. **Expectation vs. Reality:** Is the expected value positive or negative? Do you expect your account to be worth more or less than $1,000 based on this result?

## The expected value is positive with a gain of $50. Therefore, I expect my account to be worth more than $1,000.

```{python}
#| label: q2-expectation-vs-reality
#| echo: true

initial_balance = 1000
gain_rate = 0.5   # +50% on heads
loss_rate = 0.4   # -40% on tails
p_heads = 0.5
p_tails = 0.5

balance_if_heads = initial_balance * (1 + gain_rate)
balance_if_tails = initial_balance * (1 - loss_rate)
expected_value = p_heads * balance_if_heads + p_tails * balance_if_tails

is_positive = expected_value > initial_balance

print(f"Expected value: ${expected_value:,.0f}")
print("Is expected value positive?", "Yes" if expected_value > initial_balance else "No")
print("Expected balance > $1,000?", "Yes" if is_positive else "No")
```

3. **Single Simulation:** Run one simulation showing the dynamics of your account balance over time. Make an object-oriented matplotlib OR ggplot2 plot showing your simulated account balance over time (i.e. as you age). Comment on the results, are you happy?

### Questions to Answer for 85% Grade on Challenge

4. **Multiple Simulations:** Run 100 simulations modelling the dynamics of your account balance over time. Make an object-oriented matplotlib OR ggplot2 plot showing a probability distribution of the 100 simulatedaccount balance at age 55. Comment on the results, are you happy? Why or why not?

### Questions to Answer for 95% Grade on Challenge

5. **Probability Analysis:** Based on the 100 simulations above, what is the probability that your account balance will be greater than $1,000 at age 55?

### Questions to Answer for 100% Grade on Challenge

6. **Strategy Comparison:** Run 100 simulations for the modified game strategy shown below in @exm-ErgodicityEconomicsExampleModified. What is the probability that your account balance will be greater than $10,000 at age 55? Is this probability higher or lower than the probability in the original game?

### Modified Game Strategy

::: {#exm-ErgodicityEconomicsExampleModified}
Imagine you are offered the following game and given a $1,000 budget in a special account to play the game: I will flip a coin, and if it comes up heads, we increase your bet by 50%; if it comes up tails, we reduce your bet by 40%. You must bet exactly 50% of your current account balance on each flip, and this 50% is locked in for each round. We are not only doing this once, but we will do it once per year until you turn 55. When you turn 55, you will receive the balance in your account.

## Essential Simulation Concepts 🎯 {#sec-simulation-concepts}

Before diving into the challenge, let's review the key simulation concepts you'll need. These examples will prepare you for the investment game analysis.

### 1. Simple Simulation: Coin Flip Game

Let's start with a basic coin flip simulation to understand the mechanics:

#### Generative DAG Model for the Simple Coin Flip Game

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| include: false
#| eval: false
import daft

# Create the DAG for simple coin flip game
simpleCoinDAG = daft.PGM(dpi=150, alternate_style="outer")

# Coin flip (stochastic node)
simpleCoinDAG.add_node("X", "Coin Flip\n$X \\sim \\text{Bernoulli}(0.5)$", x=1, y=1, aspect=4,
                      plot_params={'facecolor': 'aliceblue'})

# Winnings (deterministic node)
simpleCoinDAG.add_node("W", "Winnings\n$W = 100$ if $X = 1$ else $-100$", x=1, y=0, aspect=5.4,
                      alternate=True, plot_params={'facecolor': 'aliceblue'})

# Add edge showing the relationship
simpleCoinDAG.add_edge("X", "W")
```

```{python}
#| label: fig-simple-coin-dag
#| fig-cap: Generative DAG model for the simple coin flip game showing the relationship between coin flip outcome and winnings
#| echo: false
#| eval: false
simpleCoinDAG.show()
```

**Key Difference from Investment Game:** Unlike the investment game DAG (@fig-investment-dag) which models wealth evolution over multiple time periods with multiplicative changes, this simple coin flip DAG represents a single-period game with additive winnings. The investment game shows how wealth compounds over time ($W_t = 1.5 \times W_{t-1}$ or $W_t = 0.6 \times W_{t-1}$), while this simple game shows fixed winnings ($W = +100$ or $W = -100$) based on a single coin flip outcome.

::: {.panel-tabset}

### Python

```{python}
#| label: simple-sim-python
#| fig-cap: Python simulation of coin flip game
#| echo: true

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Set seed for reproducibility
np.random.seed(123)

# Number of simulations
n_sims = 10

# Step 1: Draw coin flips (stochastic node)
X = np.random.binomial(n=1, p=0.5, size=n_sims)

# Step 2: Compute winnings (deterministic node)
W = np.where(X == 1, 100, -100)

# Combine into data frame
sim_data = pd.DataFrame({
    'sim_num': range(1, n_sims + 1),
    'coin_flip': X,
    'winnings': W
})

# Display results
sim_data
```

:::

### 2. Time-Series Simulation: Account Balance Over Time

Now let's simulate how an account balance changes over multiple periods:

#### Generative DAG Model for Time-Series Account Balance

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| include: false
#| eval: false
import daft

# Create the DAG for time-series simulation
timeSeriesDAG = daft.PGM(dpi=150, alternate_style="outer")

# Initial balance (deterministic)
timeSeriesDAG.add_node("B0", "Initial Balance\n$B_0 = 1000$", x=2, y=2.5, aspect=5.4,
                      alternate=True, plot_params={'facecolor': 'aliceblue'})

# Time t nodes
timeSeriesDAG.add_node("Ct", "Coin Flip t\n$C_t \\sim \\text{Bernoulli}(0.5)$", x=-3, y=1, aspect=4, scale=1.6,
                      plot_params={'facecolor': 'aliceblue'})
timeSeriesDAG.add_node("Bt", "Balance t\n$B_t = B_{t-1} + 100$ if $C_t = 1$\n$B_t = B_{t-1} - 100$ if $C_t = 0$", x=2, y=1, scale=1.6, aspect=4,
                      alternate=True, plot_params={'facecolor': 'aliceblue'})

# Add edges showing the relationships
timeSeriesDAG.add_edge("B0", "Bt")
timeSeriesDAG.add_edge("Ct", "Bt")

# Add plate around time-dependent nodes
timeSeriesDAG.add_plate([-5, 0.5, 9, 1.0], label="t = 1, ..., T", shift=-0.1)
```

```{python}
#| label: fig-timeseries-dag
#| fig-cap: Generative DAG model for time-series account balance simulation showing how balance evolves sequentially over multiple periods
#| echo: false
#| eval: false
timeSeriesDAG.show()
```

**Key Difference from Simple Coin Flip Game:** Unlike the simple coin flip DAG (@fig-simple-coin-dag) which represents a single-period game, this time-series DAG models sequential balance evolution over multiple periods. Each period's balance depends on the previous period's balance plus the current coin flip outcome. The simple game shows independent winnings per flip, while this model shows cumulative balance changes where $B_t = B_{t-1} + \Delta_t$ and $\Delta_t = +100$ or $-100$ based on the coin flip.

### Python

```{python}

#| fig-cap: Python time-series simulation of account balance
#| echo: true

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    for i in range(periods):
        coin_flip = np.random.binomial(1, 0.5)
        if coin_flip == 1:
            balance = balance + 100  # $100 gain
        else:
            balance = balance - 100  # $100 loss
        path.append(balance)
    
    return path

# Run simulation
time_series_data = pd.DataFrame({
    'period': range(n_periods + 1),
    'balance': simulate_path(initial_balance, n_periods)
})

# Create time series plot
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 6))
ax.plot(time_series_data['period'], time_series_data['balance'], 
        color='cadetblue', linewidth=2, marker='o', markersize=6)
ax.set_title('Account Balance Over Time\nSingle Simulation Path', 
             fontsize=14, fontweight='bold')
ax.set_xlabel('Period', fontsize=12)
ax.set_ylabel('Account Balance ($)', fontsize=12)
ax.grid(True, alpha=0.3)
ax.set_ylim(0, max(time_series_data['balance']) * 1.1)

# Format y-axis as currency
ax.yaxis.set_major_formatter(plt.FuncFormatter(lambda x, p: f'${x:,.0f}'))

### 3. Probability Distribution: Final Balance Distribution

Let's see what the distribution of final balances looks like across many simulations:

#| label: distribution-sim-python

        coin_flip = np.random.binomial(1, 0.5)
        if coin_flip == 1:
            balance = balance + 100  # $100 gain
        else:
            balance = balance - 100  # $100 loss
    return balance

    'final_balance': final_balances

ax.set_ylabel('Frequency', fontsize=12)
ax.legend()

# Format x-axis as currency
